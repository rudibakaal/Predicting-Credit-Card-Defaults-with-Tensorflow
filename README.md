# Predicting-Credit-Card-Defaults-with-Tensorflow

## Motivation
Neural network trained on 30,000 instances of banking data used to predict credit card default[1].

## Neural Network Topology and Results Summary
The binary-crossentropy loss function was leveraged along with the Adam optimizer for this classification problem.
